# Host the Rails app in AWS beanstalk

* Rails 6 ships with webpack for asset compilation which requires the Nodejs runtime.

* In production, Rails 6 runs the rake task `assets:precompile` to combine and minify the CSS, JS.

* If you directly deploy the Rails 6 app to the Rails env, it will fail as the Rails platform donâ€™t have a Nodejs env to execute the rake tasks.

* So finally I have settled with the docker platform which also beanstalk offers. Its a much simpler setup and deployments are more predictable.
